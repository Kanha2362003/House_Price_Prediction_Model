# House_Price_Prediction_Model
This is a full-stack machine learning project that predicts house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, and bathrooms. It simulates real-world production pipelines by implementing modular code design, REST APIs, Docker-based deployments, and CI/CD workflows.
✅ 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Modeling: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)

API Development: FastAPI

Containerization: Docker

Cloud Hosting: Render

Storage: AWS S3 (for model or data assets)

Version Control: Git + GitHub

API Testing: Postman

CI/CD: Render Deploy Hooks (instead of GitHub Actions)

✅ 🏗️ Architecture Flow
Raw data (CSV) is loaded and preprocessed.

Model training occurs using train.py.

Trained model saved as model.pkl.

FastAPI app serves /predict endpoint.

Application is containerized via Docker.

Docker image deployed to Render (cloud).

API becomes accessible via public URL.

✅ 📌 Conclusion
Successfully built and deployed a scalable, full-stack ML system that integrates data science, API development, containerization, and cloud deployment.

Demonstrated ability to structure machine learning projects with industry-standard MLOps practices.

The project serves as a template for future real estate, pricing, or regression-based systems, showing end-to-end capability from data ingestion to cloud-hosted prediction.

This project is ideal for showcasing deployment-ready ML solutions in interviews, portfolios, or resumes.


✅ 🔧 Improvements & Future Work
Improve Model: Try advanced models like XGBoost or fine-tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.

Add Features: Include more real-world inputs like location or property age.

Secure API: Add authentication (e.g., API key) to protect endpoints.

Automate CI/CD: Integrate GitHub Actions for testing and deployment.

User Interface: Create a simple Streamlit or React frontend for easy use.
